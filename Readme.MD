## Digital Wallet System

I built a secure API wallet system that allows different types of users (Noob, Elite, Admin) to manage their funds in multiple currencies. 

I developed comprehensive set of API endpoints to support user registration, login, wallet funding, withdrawals and user management.

For User Authentication, and tokenization, I implemented a secure authentication system using JSON Web Tokens to authenticate users and authorize access to the API endpoints.

I integrated currency conversion functionality using Fixer API to ensure that users can manage their funds in multiple currencies when funding or withdrawing.

For database management, I integrated SQL server database to store and manage userâ€™s information, wallet balances and transaction history.
